      <h5>More details on Hybrid:</h5>

      <p><b>Development:</b></p>
      <p>
        Initially, a function was created which took the value of the mean of the NICU and Benaron-Benitz formulae for gas flow
        rates less than 200 mL/min, and took the value of only Benaron-Benitz otherwise. The function displayed a discontinuity
        at exactly 200 mL/min as NICU predicts a non-zero FiO2 for this flow rate. Hence, the function was smoothed by
        fitting a polynomial of second degree, the coefficients of which were derived using polynomial regression. This degree
        of polynomial was chosen as a first degree (linear) polynomial did not approximate the function well at all, a third
        degree polynomial showed no significant deviation from the second degree polynomial and a fourth degree polynomial was
        too close of a fit to the discontinuity and hence displayed behaviour that would not be expected physically.
      </p>
      <p>
        The quadratic fit did show one unexpected behaviour in that it predicted a maximum FiO2 at after which FiO2
        decreases with increasing flow rate. This is in contrast to the predictions made by other models, which are all either
        monotonically increasing or monotonically increasing up to a point at which they become constant. A consequence of this
        decreasing portion was that a reverse calculator for the hybrid model would return two different gas flow rate values
        (before and after the maximum FiO2). To avoid ambiguity, the final hybrid calculator was made single-valued by taking
        the form of the quadratic fit up to the maximum FiO2 reached by Benaron-Benitz and taking that value
        for all greater flow rates.
      </p>
      <p>
        As made evident by the disclaimer on the calculator, the final hybrid model has not been peer-reviewed in any way and so medical
        practitioners should always exercise caution if choosing to use the value given by this model. The Finer and
        Benaron-Benitz models have been peer-reviewed and so their predicted FiO2 values are always displayed alongside the
        hybrid value for comparison.
